    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
      <li>6 (6oz) skinless, boneless salmon fillets</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 400°F | 200°C. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss
        together potatoes with the oil, 1/2 tablespoon of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon
        salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread out in an even layer and roast for
        15 minutes until they're just starting to soften and brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push potatoes to one side of the sheet pan and arrange salmon down the
        centre. Rub salmon evenly with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the minced garlic
        and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Add the asparagus to the other side of the
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the melted butter together
        and pour the mixture over the salmon and asparagus. Season everything
        with the remaining salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return to oven and continue baking until the potatoes are golden and
        fork-tender and the salmon is opaque throughout, (about 10 minutes).
        Optional: broil in the last 2 minutes for charred edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining butter, garlic and
        lemon juice with the wine (or chicken stock). Serve with the salmon,
        veggies and lemon slices!
